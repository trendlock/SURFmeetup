      <p><strong>E&amp;OE TRANSCRIPT<br></strong><strong>DOORSTOP<br></strong><strong>MELBOURNE<br></strong><strong>FRIDAY, 26 JANUARY 2018</strong></p>
<p><strong>SUBJECT/S: <em>Australian of the Year, trade, Australia Day, republic, cost of living. </em></strong></p><p><strong>BILL SHORTEN, LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION:</strong> Good morning everybody. I’m fortunate to be in the western Suburbs of Melbourne, welcoming 150 new Australian citizens.</p>
<p>I’d like to congratulate Australian of the Year, Michelle Simmons. Her win is a win for her and her personal hard work, but it’s also a win for science, and it’s </p>
<p>Happy to take any questions that people might have.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong> Is there any hope now that the US can re-join the TPP deal?</p>
<p><strong>SHORTEN:</strong> I think first of all we need to see if this new trade agreement stacks up. Let me be very clear, this is not the old Trans Pacific Partnership which included the United States. I was right when I said that Donald Trump had walked away from that, and he hasn’t come back. But this new arrangement, whilst it’s much </p>
<p>If it stacks up, Labor will give it the tick, if it doesn’t stack up then we’re not going to give it the tick. What we need to do is always watch out for the interests of working and middle-class Aussies, </p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong> Just back on Australia Day, we’ve already seen a few far right rallyists go to citizenship ceremonies and they’ll be holding an event in St Kilda today, what do you have to say to those people?</p>
